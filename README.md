Code test, the Mortage plan:
In this test I have been programming an mortage calculator for the centric bank Money Bin Inc. in Duckburg. The code that I have been writing comes in Javascript and HTML. 


Getting started and background: 
In the beggining when I was given the project I started to look for information of how to program the calculator. I used various programming sources on Google and videos on Youtube as my guideline. I am a self-learned programmer, mainly in Python, and therefore it was a challange to take on the task. I have programmed this code myself, with Google and Youtube as my teachers. I hope the result represents what you had in mind. Otherwise I will continue my practice in Java and apply for your summer internship again next year. 


Prerequisites:
I have coded in Eclipse, but when I realized that it was working better for me to program in an online portal I started writing my code at https://jsbin.com/?html,js,output and I used it throughout the process. In JS Bin, it's easy to program in HTML and Javascript, in the same time as displaying the output next to the code.
 


Here is the all my code with functional calculator in JS bin:

Example of how the application is running:
The application is an online calculator in which the user is putting in information and gets a calculated result in real time. The user also has a possibility to fill in thier name, but it won't affect the calculator. 


Required fill in fields: 
- Name
- Total Loan
- Interest rate
- Number of Payments
= Result (monthly payment)



Here is the output-function, the calculator, displayed in a new window:
https://jsbin.com/qixulijaka/1




Example of output: 
By taking the prospects, for example:

Juha,1000,5,2
My calcutalor gives the output:
43,87€

Karvinen,4356,1.27,6
My calcutalor gives the output:
62,87 €

Claes Månsson,1300.55,8.67,2
My calcutalor gives the output: 
59,22 €

"Clarencé,Andersson",2000,6,4
My calcutalor gives the output: 
46,97 €


The calculator is functioning well for different types of input.



Thank you for this oppurtunity. I hope this is what you are looking for. I will continue practice Java during the spring 2020.

Best regards,

Victoria Helin
